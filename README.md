# Automation Testing Projects

This folder contains my automation testing work performed using Selenium IDE as part of university coursework and hands-on QA practice.

## Project: Web Application Automation Testing

### Description
Automation testing was conducted on a web application to validate critical user flows and ensure that core functionalities work consistently across test runs.

Selenium IDE was used to record and execute automated test cases for common user interactions.

### Scope of Automation
- Page navigation
- Form input handling
- Button clicks and link verification
- Basic functional flows

### Test Artifacts
- Selenium IDE `.side` file containing recorded and edited test cases
- Automated steps include commands such as `open`, `click`, `type`, and `assert`

### Challenges Faced
- Identifying stable locators for dynamic web elements
- Handling element loading delays
- Improving reliability by switching to CSS selectors and XPath where necessary

### Tools Used
- Selenium IDE
- Web browser (Chrome)

### Learning Outcomes
- Understanding the basics of test automation
- Recording and editing Selenium IDE scripts
- Working with locators (ID, CSS Selector, XPath)
- Recognizing limitations of record-and-playback tools

> Note: This automation work demonstrates my foundational knowledge of Selenium-based testing and my ability to apply automation concepts at an entry level.

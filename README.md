This folder contains my manual testing work carried out as part of university coursework and hands-on QA practice on real web applications.

## Project: Sri Lanka Travel Web Application

### Description
Manual testing was performed on a tourism-related web application to verify core functionalities, usability, and input validations from an end-user perspective.

### Scope of Testing

- Positive and negative test scenarios

### Test Artifacts
- Detailed test cases documented in PDF format
- Each test case includes:
  - Test Case ID
  - Test Scenario
  - Test Steps
  - Expected Result
  - Actual Result
  - Test Status (Pass/Fail)

### Key Areas Tested
- Page navigation and links
- Search functionality
- Form inputs (valid and invalid data)
- Email and field validation
- Error handling and system responses

### Bugs & Observations

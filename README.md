# Performance Testing Projects

This folder contains my performance and load testing work conducted using Apache JMeter as part of university coursework and practical QA training.

## Project: Web Application Performance Testing

### Description
Performance testing was performed on a web application to evaluate its behavior under different load conditions and to identify potential performance bottlenecks.

Apache JMeter was used to simulate multiple users accessing the system simultaneously and to measure key performance metrics.

### Scope of Testing
- Load testing
- Basic performance analysis
- Response time evaluation
- Error rate observation

### Test Artifacts
- JMeter `.jmx` test plan file
- Configured thread groups, samplers, and listeners

### Test Configuration
- Simulated multiple concurrent users
- Controlled ramp-up period and loop count
- Monitored system behavior during execution

### Metrics Observed
- Response time
- Throughput
- Error percentage
- Request success/failure behavior

### Observations & Findings
- System response time varied with increased load
- Performance remained stable under normal load conditions
- Identified potential performance limitations when user load increased

### Tools Used
- Apache JMeter

### Learning Outcomes
- Understanding load vs performance testing
- Creating and executing JMeter test plans
- Analyzing performance metrics
- Interpreting test results to assess system stability

> Note: This project demonstrates my foundational understanding of performance testing concepts and my ability to use JMeter for evaluating system behavior under load.

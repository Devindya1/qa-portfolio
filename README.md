# QA Portfolio

This repository showcases my hands-on work in Software Testing and Quality Assurance, developed through university coursework and practical experimentation on real web applications.

The projects included here demonstrate my understanding of core QA concepts, testing methodologies, and commonly used testing tools.

## Areas Covered

- Manual Testing  
- Automation Testing (Selenium IDE)  
- Performance & Load Testing (Apache JMeter)

## Repository Structure

qa-portfolio/
├── manual-testing/ # Test cases and functional testing documentation
├── automation-testing/ # Selenium IDE automation scripts
├── performance-testing/ # JMeter performance and load testing artifacts
└── README.md


## Tools & Technologies

- Selenium IDE  
- Apache JMeter  
- Manual testing techniques  
- Web application testing concepts  

## Workflow

Each testing area was developed in a separate branch and later merged into the main branch.  
This approach was used to maintain clarity, organization, and version control throughout the work.

## Purpose

This repository is intended to demonstrate my readiness for an entry-level QA / Software Testing internship by presenting structured testing artifacts and practical tool usage.

> Note: These projects were completed as part of academic coursework and hands-on practice and are shared for learning and portfolio purposes.
